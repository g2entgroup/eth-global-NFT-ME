# eth-global-NFT-ME

The premise of this project is to provide quality assurance and payment of an item through a staged supply chain of a minted NFT.

This minted Token in the NFT Contract (ERC721) will become "sellable" once all stages are complete. This provides full supply chain and provenance visibility.

Some future considerations will be to look into hiding supplier costs so the owner can have competing margins between suppliers.
